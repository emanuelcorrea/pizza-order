## Introduction

**Pizzify Backend Technical Overview**

Pizzify's backend, built with Java and Spring Boot, facilitates online pizza orders and manages crucial entities like Customers, Orders, Pizzas, Categories, and the Cart. Key features include:

- **üëß Customers:** User profiles for login, order tracking, and preferences.

- **üìÉ Orders:** Central entity recording order details, customer information, and order history.

- **üçï Pizzas:** Independent entities with attributes like flavor, size, ingredients, and price.

- **üì¶ Categories:** Organizes pizzas logically for a user-friendly online menu.

- **üõí Cart:** Allows customers to add pizzas, providing an intuitive shopping experience.

The backend employs a relational database with Hibernate for efficient data management. **RESTful** endpoints enable interaction with the frontend, and security measures include authentication and authorization. The modular, scalable architecture supports easy expansion and integration, laying a robust foundation for the entire Pizzify ecosystem.
